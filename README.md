# Data Reader

## Introduction

This data reader can handle big data file size fast data reading and loading. It reads data from bytes instead of using any Java file API.

## Data Validation

Data validation validates the input data based on user-specified settings for each type of data file (Tabular or Covariance data).

## Data Reading/Loading

## Utilities

### Data Preview

It's very hard to show a preview of a big data file, that's why this utility was created to ease the preview.

### Delimiter Inference

Reads the first few lines of data in a text file and attempts to infer what delimiter is in use.
